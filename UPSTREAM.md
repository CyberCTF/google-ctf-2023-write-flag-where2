| `build/challenge/app/` | [`2023/quals/pwn-write-flag-where2`](https://github.com/google/google-ctf/tree/4a8f8d7808254d40f226ac2ab4604601e0e57d57/2023/quals/pwn-write-flag-where2) |

The vendored folder is that commit's challenge folder, unchanged, without its Git history. The flag
is upstream's own (the `flag` file the Dockerfile copies into the chroot).

The archive does not commit the compiled binary (kCTF builds it with `make -C challenge` before `docker build`), so `build/challenge/Dockerfile` is upstream's Dockerfile plus a first stage that runs the challenge's own Makefile on the chroot's base image; its header lists every difference.

To update, replace the vendored folder with a newer google-ctf commit, then change this file.
